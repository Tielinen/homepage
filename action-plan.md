# Action Plan — from “highest‑impact, lowest‑dependency” to “nice‑to‑have”

| Phase | Goal | Why it comes **now** | Key tasks (in sequence) |
|-------|------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **1. Instant credibility (½ day)** | Show proof *while interest is hottest* | Social proof near the promise converts quickest. | 1. Place **Shopify Foundations**, **Liquid Storefronts**, and **Upwork Top‑Rated +** badges in a tight row under the hero CTA (max 4).<br>2. Surface 2‑3 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ reviews with star icons directly below badges.<br>3. Keep full carousel lower. |
| **7. Post‑launch optimizations (ongoing)** | Iterate with real users | Needs traffic & data. | • Hotjar recordings & polls.<br>• Scroll‑based image swaps on portfolio grid.<br>• Schedule periodic performance audits.<br>• A/B test alternative CTAs once traffic allows. |


+ Finish Phases 0‑2 before you spend a cent on ads.
That gets the promise + proof in place—minimum viable credibility.

+ Add Phase 3 (pricing & depth) before you scale spend beyond a test budget.
Cold visitors need price anchoring and deeper content to feel safe booking a call.

+ Wrap up Phase 4 in the same sprint, ideally within the first week of live traffic.
Meta tags and heading structure improve ad CTR and future‑proof your SEO; they rarely affect visuals, so you can finish them with the site live.

+ Run Phases 5‑7 as background sprints while campaigns are running.
They’re mostly invisible improvements—just schedule deployments during low‑traffic hours or use feature flags.

+ Phase 8 is continuous.
Use the traffic you’re paying for to feed Hotjar recordings, polls, and A/B tests—the very data you need for the next round of wins.
