# Techniques for low-traffic websites
## Why conversion is hard for low-traffic websites

If you are a startup or a small company, you are in a chicken-and-egg situation:
+ To afford visitors, you need a good conversion rate.
+ But it’s hard to improve your conversion rate if you have no visitors.

Low-traffic websites have two problems:
+ Problem 1: How can you understand your visitors? For example, how can you find out what’s stopping them from taking action? It’s not easy when there aren’t many of them to ask. Tumbleweed can’t tell you how it feels.
+ Problem 2: How can you measure what works? High-traffic websites rely on A/B tests to measure whether their changes make a statistically significant difference. But A/B tests often don’t reach significance when there isn’t enough traffic.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, take heart in the knowledge that every successful company has had to pass through this stage at one point.

We’ll tackle the first of those problems now. We’ll address Problem 2 later, in the chapter on A/B testing.

## The solution to Problem 1: The techniques you should use to understand your visitors if your website doesn’t get much traffic

Some of the techniques we mention in this section rely upon a website getting lots of traffic. Some surveys, for example, typically get a completion rate of 3%. If your business is small, we recommend that you make the most of the following techniques, which can be carried out even if your website gets just a few visitors per day. Each of them is described in detail in the following chapters:
+ User tests tend to be the most fruitful technique. Ask a friend—or anyone you can get your hands on—to participate. Once your website is refined enough, aim to user test it on people who are from your target demographic and psychographic.
+ Watch session recordings of the visitors you have. Doing so will give you insight into how web visitors see your website. Plus, you’ll see your creation through fresh eyes.
+ Speak to salespeople (what we call “VOC Aggregators”)—people who have sold face-to-face the same type of product—or similar products.
+ Analyze competitors’ websites. Or, if you don’t have any obvious competitors, look at companies that are successful within adjacent fields. For example, if you sell B2B software, look at other B2B software vendors.
+ Add your phone number prominently to the top of every page. Even if you have no plans to encourage phone calls on an ongoing basis, it can help to get at least a few of them. In fact, you may be able to charm your early callers into becoming long-term user testers.
+ Increase the incentives for visitors to complete surveys. The more you offer as an incentive, the higher percentage of responses you are likely to get.
